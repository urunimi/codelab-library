Codelab library for Android.
=============

## Introduction

This project is made for easy access to Application Context and easy logging.


## Quick Start

This library is pushed to Maven Central as an AAR. Therefore, the easiest way to add this to your project is via Gradle, you just need to add the following dependency to your build.gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {  
    mavenCentral()
    compile 'com.hovans.android:library:+'
}
```

This means that you will always use the latest version available.
